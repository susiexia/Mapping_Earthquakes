# Mapping_Earthquakes

Traverse and retrieve GeoJSON data to populate a geographical map about earthquakes using JavaScript, D3.js and leaflet.js libraries as well as API.


## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Project Approach

- Use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.

- Use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Project Process   Create interactivity for the earthquake data, add legend control and layer control as well as popup circleMarker based on magnitude level.

- Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.

- Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.

- Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.

- Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.

- Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.

- Render maps on a local server.

## Project Result

Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.
